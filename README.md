## model 1
SVM model exhibited promising performance metrics, including 71% precision, 85% recall, 78% F1-score and 81% ROC-AUC score indicating its ability to correctly classify CKD cases.
## model 2
Following the SVM model, a linear regression model was implemented, yielding remarkable results with an accuracy of 97.5%. The precision score was 100%, recall score: 94%, F1-score 96.5% and ROC-AUC score was 97%. 

The linear regression model achieved high precision and recall scores for both positive and negative CKD cases, highlighting its robust performance across different classes.
